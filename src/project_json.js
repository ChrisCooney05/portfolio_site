Withdraw, deposit and print statement. There is no front end with this program, users interact by using the terminal and node.",

    "description": "This was my first exploration into using React and fetching data using an API. On receipt of data, individual cards are generated per user and rendered onto the screen. A filter box was added so that whilst a user types a name in, the applications state is updated and the cards rendered updates accordingly. Alongside learning React, it was also a great opportunity for me to explore using Tachyons for a large portion on the CSS and layout. The App can be seen in action",

    "description": "The final project produced by myself and 3 others as part of my Makers journey This project was different in a way as it was the first time during the course that we were given the chance to build an app of our choosing from the ground up. We decided that we wanted to produce a game for children, designed to spark an interest in code and help develop problem-solving/explorative skills. A number of the technologies were either brand new or only partially understood by our team, so we had to work together to ensure everyone learned and developed at the same pace, whilst still keeping on track for a tight deadline.",
